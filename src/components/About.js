              Get ready to embark on an incredible journey with meâ€”
              <br />a journey that took me from the world of tool and die making
              to the thrilling realm of coding.
              <br /> This is a story that defies expectations and ignites a
              passionate love for technology. Let's dive in and discover how one
              unexpected twist changed the course of my life forever
            </h6>
            <p>
              In 2008, I embarked on a life-changing adventure in India,
              pursuing a diploma in tool and die making. For three years, I
              dedicated myself to full-time study, fueling my passion for
              learning and personal growth. This experience laid the foundation
              for my future endeavors when I made the decision to move to
              Canada.
              <br />
              At Sheridan College, I continued my education and specialized in
              tool making over a period of two years. Through focused
              coursework, I deepened my understanding of this craft and achieved
              a tool making provincial license from the esteemed Ontario Trade
              School. With over a decade of experience as a tool and die maker,
              I developed a strong skill set and consistently delivered
              exceptional results.
              <br />
              However, life took an unexpected turn in 2021. An accident
              disrupted my career trajectory and forced me to reassess my
              professional path. While it was a challenging and disheartening
              time, I refused to let it define me. Instead, I embraced the
              opportunity for a fresh start and set my sights on the world of
              coding.

                  <br /> Transitioning into the tech field presented its own set
                  of challenges. Coming from a manufacturing background, I had
                  limited knowledge of the digital landscape. But my
                  determination pushed me forward. Drawing upon my elementary
                  understanding of HTML from my early years, I embarked on a
                  journey of self-guided learning. I sought guidance from
                  various sources, such as books, YouTube videos, and blogs,
                  absorbing as much knowledge as possible.
                  <br /> Each step in my coding journey brought a sense of
                  accomplishment. I vividly remember the excitement of printing
                  a star pattern on my consoleâ€”a small but significant
                  achievement that symbolized the untapped potential within me.
                  To maximize my learning opportunities, I transformed my car
                  into a mobile learning station, embracing coding during my
                  spare moments while working as an Uber driver.
                  <br /> After ten months of unwavering dedication and countless
                  lines of code, I reached a pivotal milestoneâ€”I successfully
                  deployed my very first fully functional website. It was a
                  moment of immense pride and realization. I discovered a deep
                  passion for coding, finding joy in every line I wrote and
                  every project I completed. This journey has taught me that
                  with determination and persistence, anyone can achieve
                  extraordinary things, regardless of their background or access
                  to mentors.
                  <br />
                  Today, I stand tall, ready to embrace new challenges and
                  continue my growth as a developer. Each day presents an
                  opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills, and I eagerly
                  pursue those opportunities. I am driven by a desire to connect
                  with remarkable individuals who appreciate the value of hard
                  work and share in the joy of creative achievement.

                  As you explore my portfolio, I invite you to witness the
                  transformation of a tool and die maker into a passionate
                  coder. Together, let's harness the power of technology, engage
                  in meaningful discussions, and shape a future brimming with
                  boundless possibilities.
